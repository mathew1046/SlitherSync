### How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è  

SlitherSync uses your mobile phone's built-in sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope) to detect steps. These inputs are fused for accuracy and then translated into in-game commands for snake movement.  

The app connects to two main APIs:  
* **Google Fit API** ‚Üí Fetches and displays daily step counts.  
* **OpenWeatherMap API** ‚Üí Provides real-time weather data.  

Additionally, device **GPS location** is used to fetch coordinates, which can be reverse-geocoded into a city name for contextual weather info.
